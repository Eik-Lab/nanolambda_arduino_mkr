# NanoLambda library with examples!
#### (Examples modified for the Arduino MKR Series!)
All example codes have been modified to work with the Arduino MKR boards, but nanoLambda has developed all the code. <br />
Example FYS203 has been developed by Eik Lab with code from other examples. <br /><br />
All code is licensed under "Apache license 2.0", which means all code can be modified and used under all circumstances as long as the copyright holders are kept.

### How to install the library!

  1. Press the green "Code" button and download as a zip.
  2. Exctract the files and compress only the "NanoLambdaNSP32_FYS203" as zip.
  3. Open Arduino IDE, press "Sketch" -> "Include library" -> "Add ZIP-library" and choose the zipped NanoLambdaNSP32_FYS203_FYS203 folder.
  4. Restart Arduino IDE. <br />

The examples should now appear in "File" -> "Examples" -> "NanoLambdaNSP32_FYS203".

### Wiring setup (COMING!)
  1. ...

### Compile and run an example (Not complete!)

  1. Choose an example
  2. Choose correct board. Goto "Tools" -> "Board" and select a board
  3. Choose correct port. Goto "Tools" -> "Port" and select a port, often named "COMXX(Board name)"
  4. Press the right arrow in the Arduino IDE (next to the check icon), and it will compile, load the code into the board and run the code.
